Thank you for the challenge, it was fun trying to translate this design into a webpage!

A couple of notes:

- You will notice comments in the SASS files regarding the appearance of certain fonts/colors. 
I noticed that in certain cases I did not get a result that matched the appearance in the design.
This might be due to a mistake on my part. I noted my opinion on what would look closer to the design,
but I stuck to the information provided by the handoff. 

- I downloaded a new set of social media icons, as the size of the .png icons included in the handoff 
was 90x96, which made it difficult to achieve the desired result. To my knowledge, they are exactly
the same in appearance as the ones provided by the handoff.

- Sending out the contact form email for the first time might require email verification as it is handled by formsubmit.co

- Minimum device width required for a fully-functioning design is 350px, the design breaks under 340px. 

Thank you again for the opportunity, and I'm looking forward to hearing your feedback!
